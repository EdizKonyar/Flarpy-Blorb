**Language:** C#
**Key Mechanics:** Object pooling for obstacles, custom physics for player movement, UI score management.

What I Learned
In this project, I focused on learning the basics of the Unity Physics engine. I encountered an issue where the bird would fall too fast, so I wrote a custom gravity script to make the gameplay feel smoother.
